j, k, 0 and $ all interact with real lines, while prefixing any of these with g tells Vim to act on display lines instead.


Delimited Text Objects
Text Object     Selection
a)              A pair of ()
i)              Inside of ()
at              A pair of <xml>tags</xml>
it              Inside of <xml>tags</xml>

Vim's text objects fall into two categories: those that interact with pairs of delimiters, such as i), i", and it, and 
those that interact with chunks of text, such as words, sentences, and paragraphs.
Keystrokes      Buffer Contents
iw              Current word
aw              Current word plus one space
iW              Current WORD
aW              Current WORD plus one space
is              Current sentence
as              Current sentence plus one space
ip              Current paragraph
ap              Current paragraph plus one blank line

As a general rule, we could say that the d{motion} command tends to work well with aw, as, and ap, whereas the c{motion} command works 
better with iw and similar.

The <C-o> command is like the back button, while the complementary <C-i>
command is like the forward button.
<C-o> and <C-i> commands will always be scoped to the jump list of the active
window.

Use the g; and g, commands, we can traverse backward and forward through the
change list.


If we leave Insert mode and then scroll around the document, we can quickly
carry on where we left off by pressing gi

gf -> go to file
