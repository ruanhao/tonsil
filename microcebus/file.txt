Vim provides several key mappings for resizing windows.
Keystrokes | Buffer Contents
-----------|------------------------------------------
<C-w>=     | Equalize width and height of all windows
<C-w>_     | Maximize height of the active window
<C-w>|     | Maximize width of the active window
[N]<C-w>_  | Set active window height to [N] rows
[N]<C-w>|  | Set active window width to [N] columns



The :lcd {path} command lets us set the working directory locally for the
current window. If we create a new tab page and then use the :lcd command to
switch to another directory, we can then comfortablely scope each tab page to
a different project.
Note that :lcd applies locally to the current window, not to the current tab
page. If we have a tab page containing two or more split windows, we could set
the local working directory for all of them by running :windo lcd {path}

Command                 Effect
:tabe[dit] {filename}   Open {filename} in a new tab
<C-w>T                  Move the current window into its own tab
:tabc[lose]             Close the current tab page and all lof its windows
:tabo[nly]              Keep the active tab page, closing all others
